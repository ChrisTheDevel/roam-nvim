# roam-nvim

This repo contains a wiki management / linked thinking plugin for nvim!
It's heavily inspired by the org-roam plugin, obsidian and of course roam itself.

*NOTE* This project is currently in it's infancy. All commits will be done on main until a stable version 0.0.1 release is finished.
